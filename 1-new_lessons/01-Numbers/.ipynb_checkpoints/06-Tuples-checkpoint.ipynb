    "\n",
    "You may be wondering, \"Why bother using tuples when they have fewer available methods?\" To be honest, tuples are not used as often as lists in programming, but are used when immutability is necessary. If in your program you are passing around an object and need to make sure it does not get changed, then a tuple becomes your solution. It provides a convenient source of data integrity.\n",
