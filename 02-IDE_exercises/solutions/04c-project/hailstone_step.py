# Description: Wrote a function for a hailstone sequence where a given number, if even is divided by two and if odd is multiplied by 3 and added by 1. The result will go through the 
#              same process until the result terminates at a value of 1.


def hailstone(n) -> int:
    """takes an integer, 'n' and if even divides by 2 and if odd multiples by 3 and adds 1 the result continues until
    the value reaches 1 and the function terminates and returns the count the number of steps """
    count: int = 0
    n: int
    while n != 1:
        print(count, n)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n //= 2
        else:
            n = (n * 3) + 1

        count += 1
    return count


number: int = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
print("The count is: ", hailstone(number))
