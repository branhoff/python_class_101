# project-5a

Write a **recursive** function named multiply that takes two positive integers as parameters and returns the product of those two numbers (the result from multiplying them together).  Your program should not use multiplication - it should find the result by using only addition.  To get your thinking on the right track:
```
7 * 4 = 7 + (7 * 3)
7 * 3 = 7 + (7 * 2)
7 * 2 = 7 + (7 * 1)
7 * 1 = 7
So, 7 * 4 = 7 + (7 + (7 + (7)))
```

**Your code must not contain any loops.**

The file must be named: multiply.py
