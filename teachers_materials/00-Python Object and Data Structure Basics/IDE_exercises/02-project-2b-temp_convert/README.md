Write a program that converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures.  The formula is:

F = (9/5)C + 32

where F is the Fahrenheit temperature and C is the Celsius temperature.  The program should prompt the user to input a Celsius temperature and should display the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature.  It should display only the converted temperature on its own line without additional text (such as an 'F').  When you run your program, it should match the following format:
```
Please enter a Celsius temperature.
-10.5
The equivalent Fahrenheit temperature is:
13.1
```
Don't worry if your program says that -10.5 Celsius is very, very close to, but not exactly, 13.1.  Your result only needs to match to 7 decimal places.  For example, 13.0999999999 would count as correct.

The file must be named: temp_convert.py
