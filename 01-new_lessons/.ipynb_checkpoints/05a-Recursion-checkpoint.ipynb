    "As mentioned in the overview, a recursive function is a function that calls itself. Each time it calls itself, a separate copy is created that has its own values for its parameters and variables. Of course, if every copy creates another copy, then the recursion will never end, and we'll run out of memory, so it's crucial that every recursive function have one or more base cases. A base case is a case where the function doesn't call itself.\n",

    "When running a recursive function, multiple copies of the function will be active at once, but only the most recent one will be executing - the others are paused while waiting for a result. When a recursive call is made, the computer needs to save our place in the current copy of the function, so that we can come back to it later. Then we can start executing a new copy of the function. The computer saves our place in the current copy by storing its information on the **call stack**, which keeps track of all active function calls.

For example, if we start at 3, the sequence goes: 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. If we find the number of steps it takes to go from 10 to 1, then we can just add 1 more step to get the number of steps it takes to go from 3 to 1."
