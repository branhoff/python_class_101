# project-3a

Write a program that asks the user how many integers they would like to enter.  You can assume that this initial input will be an integer >= 1.  The program will then prompt the user to enter that many integers.  After all the numbers have been entered, the program should display the largest and smallest of those numbers (no, you cannot use lists, or any other material we haven't covered).  When you run your program it should match the following format:
```
How many integers would you like to enter?
4
Please enter 4 integers.
-4
105
2
-7
min: -7
max: 105
```
Hints: How many numbers do you actually need to remember at a time?  If someone were reciting a long list of numbers to you, and you had to tell them the max and min at the end, how would you do it?  How should you initialize your variables?  What happens if the user only enters one integer?

The file must be named: min_max.py
